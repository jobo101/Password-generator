# Password-generator

## Description

This project was created as a weekly challenge to create a random password generator.
The password generator is necessary to create unique, safe and secure passwords.
The HTML and CSS code had already been implemented.
The coding required a password generator to be produced using already set up arrays of characters.

## Usage

The user is presented with a dialogue box in which they are prompted to enter what characters they wish their password
to contain.  The user must select at least one, otherwise the user is redirected to enter type again.
The user is then asked for the length of the password which must be between 10 and 64.
If the user selects values outside these parameters then they are prompted to enter correct values.
The outcome should be a unique password consisting of the types of characters they required.

## Licence

Please refer to the licence in the repo.

## Tests

Testing was done throughtout.  The application is not complete as I was unable to produce a password to the screen.
